# ICS4U Encapsulation

Your job is to create some classes for Bank Accounts.
You should have three classes:
BankAccount, which is the "parent" class
ChequingAccount, which "inherits" from BankAccount
SavingsAccount, which "inherits" from BankAccount

Your Bank accounts should have the ability to deposit money, withdraw money, check your balance, and any other things you think might be necessary.

I'm also looking for proper Python "Encapsulation" (with those single underscores). There should be no member variable (class attribute) that are intended to be accessed without the use of a method.

When you submit this, let me know so I can give you some hints / advice. This is only being marked out of 2 for completeion / base understanding.
Don't forget your comments and doscrings :)
